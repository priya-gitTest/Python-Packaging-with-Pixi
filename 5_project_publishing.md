- Learn how to use tools such as `build` and `twine`.
- Understand how to upload a Python package to repositories such as **TestPyPI**.
- Learn how to install and test an uploaded package.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction
Once a project has been created and all the necessary metadata has been defined in the TOML file, the next step is to **publish** it. This lesson introduces the tools and steps required to achieve this.

The two key tools we need are:

**Build** – for generating distribution files from your project.

**Twine** – for securely uploading those distributions to **PyPI** or **TestPyPI**.

##  Step 1: Create your build

The `build` tool reads your `pyproject.toml` file and generates the package distribution files.

```bash
pixi add --pypi build
```
     
```output
✔ Added build >=1.3.0, <2
Added these as pypi-dependencies.
```
Empty the depenencies under `[project]` and move/edit them to `[tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]` section, like shown below:

```toml
[project]
dependencies = []

[tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]
requests = ">=2.32.5,<3"
build = ">=1.3.0,<2"
```
Then run the `build` command:

```bash
pixi run python -m build
```
     
```output
 * Creating isolated environment: venv+pip...
* Installing packages in isolated environment:
  - hatchling
* Getting build dependencies for sdist...
* Building sdist...
* Building wheel from sdist
* Creating isolated environment: venv+pip...
* Installing packages in isolated environment:
  - hatchling
* Getting build dependencies for wheel...
* Building wheel...
Successfully built greet_me-0.1.0.tar.gz and greet_me-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
 ```
      
This command creates a `dist` directory containing two files:

- A wheel file (`greet_me-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`).
- A source archive (`greet_me-0.1.0.tar.gz`).

## Step 2 : Create an account on TestPyPI
     
- Visit [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) and create an account.
- Generate an **API token** from your account settings.
- Save the token securely, as you will use it during the upload process.

## Step 3: Upload your build
The **Twine** tool is used to securely upload your package distributions.
Install `twine` and modify the `pyroject.toml` file as you did for `build` tool above.
 
```bash
pixi add --pypi twine
```

```toml
     [project]
     dependencies = []
     
     [tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]
     requests = ">=2.32.5,<3"
     build = ">=1.3.0,<2"
```
Now upload the package to TestPyI
```bash
   pixi run twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
  You will be prompted for your TestPyPI API Token, so keep it handy and paste it, when prompted. Use the API token instead of your password by entering `__token__` as the username and pasting the token when prompted for a password.

After a successful upload, your package will be available at a URL such as: E.g. : 
[https://test.pypi.org/project/greet-me/0.1.0/](https://test.pypi.org/project/greet-me/0.1.0/).

## Handling Errors
If the package name is too similar to an existing project, TestPyPI may return a 403 Forbidden or 400 Bad Request error.
In that case you may end up in an error like this : 

```output
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

This isn't always helpful and you should try this command as tipped in the error message above to know more.

```bash
pixi run twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* --verbose
```

         Bad Request                    
```

To fix this, 
- Rename your  Package Folder, [project].name (e.g. from `greet_me` to `greet_me1`) and also change this section, `[tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]`
  
```toml
[project]
name = "greet-me1" # Changed

[tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]
requests = ">=2.32.5,<3"
build = ">=1.3.0,<2"
twine = ">=6.2.0,<7"
greet_me1 = { path = ".", editable = true } # Changed

[tool.pixi.tasks]
start = "python -c 'from greet_me1 import happy; print(happy.greet_happy())'" # Changed
```
- Rebuild and upload the package.

```bash
# 1. (Recommended) Remove the old build directory
rm -rf dist

# 2. Re-build your package with the new name
pixi run python -m build

# 3. Upload the new version to TestPyPI
pixi run twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* 
```

## Step 4: Test your package

Create a new repository with a readme file, open a new codespace, and install your package from TestPyPI via this command:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ greet-me1==0.1.0
```

```output

Installing collected packages: greet-me1
Successfully installed greet-me1-0.1.7
```

Then create a test script : `test_package.py`:

```python
from greet_me1 import happy, sad

print(happy.greet_happy())
```
Run it:
```bash
python test_package.py 
```

```output
Yay! happy day! 😀
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints
- Ensure all metadata is filled in and choose a **unique project name**.
- Use `build` to generate distribution files
- Create a TestPyPI account and generate an  **API token**
- Use `twine upload` to securely publish your package.
- Test your package by installing it from TestPyPI via `pip install`.
